# AlgoJS
AlgoJS utilizes Algo with JavaScript (Self explanatory lol)
Started building with PHP and NodeJS each with database integrations for transactions, and is basically a barebones template
that allows you to send receive Algo from peer-to-peer.

I want to try to make Algo (ISO coin) a modern occurence in the financial world.

Contributions can be made to Algo address EIBG3J6YH6OJV6VIBS2YDDGRADAVVH3XU25IWPI3NAGKPC3IFJ7AKFSDGI
This will be used to support AlgoJS (as well as Algo indirectly)
